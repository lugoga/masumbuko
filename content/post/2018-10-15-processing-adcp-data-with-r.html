<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Second International Indian Ocean Expedition (IIOE-2) collected various oceanographic data within the coastal water of Tanzania. Among the oceanographic data collected using Agulhas II, is the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiles (ADCP). The measurement was carried out from 4<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> November 2017. In this post, I will illustrate how to process the ADCP data with R using <code>oce</code> package developed by <span class="citation">Kelley &amp; Richards (<a href="#ref-oce">2018</a>)</span>. First, we need to load other packages needed for this routine using <code>require()</code> function <span class="citation">(Cheng, Karambelkar, &amp; Xie, <a href="#ref-leaflet">2018</a>; Grolemund &amp; Wickham, <a href="#ref-lubridate">2011</a>; Kelley, <a href="#ref-ocedata">2015</a>; Pebesma, <a href="#ref-sf">2018</a>; Wickham, <a href="#ref-tidyverse">2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>require(oce)

<div id="ingestion-of-the-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Ingestion of the data</h3>
<p>Once the package needed for this routine are loaded, we can start processing the data. However, we need to import this dataset into the workspace using the <code>read.adp()</code> function from <code>oce</code> package</p>
<pre class="r"><code>adp = read.adp(&quot;./AGU028002_000000.LTA&quot;)
# summary(adp)
time = adp[[&quot;time&quot;]]</code></pre>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:fig1">1</a> show the velocity of zonal (north) and meridional (east) components from the raw data as captured by the ADCP instrument. These velocities were measured along the coastal of Tanzania water from 2017-11-04 17:22:17 off Unguja Island close to Chwaka Bay and finish on 2017-11-09 02:02:23 in Mtwara.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(adp, which = c(1:2), 
     tformat = &quot;%B %d, %Y:%H:%M&quot;, 
     missingColor = &quot;grey&quot;, 
     ylim = c(25,1000),
     zlim = c(-4,6),
     useSmoothScatter = TRUE,
     ytype = &quot;profile&quot;,
     titles = c(&quot;Northing Profiles&quot;,&quot;Northing Profiles&quot; ),
     col = oceColorsViridis(125),

<div id="ensemble-adp-objects" class="section level3">
<h3>Ensemble adp objects</h3>
<p>The grey-colored in figure <a href="#fig:fig1">1</a> are bad data mostly comes from single-ping velocity. Therefore, data are averaged to reduce the measurement uncertainty to acceptable levels <span class="citation">(Kelley &amp; Richards, <a href="#ref-oce">2018</a>)</span>. Ensemble refers as a process of averaging ping profiles from ADCP data. This approach is important because it remove the uncertainty in velocity estimates from single pings, it also reduce the size of high frequency data, which reduce processing time. I used <code>adpEnsembleAverage()</code> function from <code>oce</code> package to ensemble (average) the profiles as shown in the chunk below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ensembled = adp%&gt;%adpEnsembleAverage(n = 10, leftover = TRUE, na.rm = TRUE)

# summary(ensembled)</code></pre>
<p>The ADCP object profiles were reduced by a factor of 10 and since they were average, the command <code>na.rm = TRUE</code> was parsed to ensure that profiles without values are also computed. The origin adcp file had a total of 1257 profiles, which were reduced to 126 with the <code>adpEnsembleAverage</code>. Figure <a href="#fig:fig2">2</a> show the velocity of zonal (north) and meridional (east) components of ensembled (average ping profiles) recorded by the ADCP instrument.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(ensembled, which = c(1:2), 
     tformat = &quot;%B %d, %Y:%H:%M&quot;, 
     missingColor = &quot;grey&quot;, 
     ylim = c(25,1000),
     zlim = c(-4,6),
     useSmoothScatter = TRUE,
     ytype = &quot;profile&quot;,
     titles = c(&quot;Northing Profiles&quot;,&quot;Northing Profiles&quot; ),
     col = oceColorsViridis(125),
     marginsAsImage = TRUE, decimate = FALSE)</code></pre>

<div id="depth-cell-mapping" class="section level3">
<h3>Depth cell mapping</h3>
<p>The averaged profile (figure <a href="#fig:fig2">2</a>) were then aligned to the uniform depthâ€”a process referred as <code>depth cell mapping</code>. Figure <a href="#fig:fig3">3</a> show the cells that aligned to the standard depth. This process is important because it ensure horizontal homogeneity of cells that are at the same depth, which compensate the pitch and roll of the instrument during ship cruising. This only works for adcp data that are in beam coordinates.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ensembled.bin = binmapAdp(ensembled)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>## plot the ensembled

<h3>Subset ADCP</h3>
<p>Since I am interested on the current between Lindi and Mafia Island (Figure <a href="#fig:fig5">5</a>), I ought to chop the pings that fall within the area. Unfortunately the function <code>subset()</code>, which I used, only capable of chopping adcp data using either time or distance. Based on figure <a href="#fig:fig4">4</a>, only the pings profiles within the areas were selected by visual inspection of the points on the map and then use the date file to filter those pings with <code>subset()</code> function. Once the pings were selected, then <code>distance, longitude, latitude, v, u</code> were extracted. Using the <code>u</code> and <code>v</code> component, the <code>velocity</code> was computed with the equation <a href="#eq:eqn1">(1)</a></p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:eqn1">\[
\begin{equation}
Velocity (ms^{-1})\:=\: \sqrt{(U^2+V^2)} \tag{1}

<h3>Compute Absolute velocity</h3>
<p>The ADCP measure a relative velocity to the earth, to obtain an absolute velocity, we need to substract the relative velocity with the ship velocity using the mathematical equation <a href="#eq:eqn2">(2)</a></p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:eqn2">\[
\begin{equation}
  \beta \: = \gamma\: - \epsilon \: \tag{2}
\end{equation}
\]</span> where; <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = <em>absolute velocity</em>; <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> = <em>relative velocity</em>; <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> = <em>ship velocity</em></p>
<p>The mathematical equation <a href="#eq:eqn2">(2)</a> was used to compute the absolute velocity in R involves two-steps as illustrated in the chunk below. First the ship velocity was determined at each profile ping. Second, the relative velocity was substracted with this ship velocity to obtain absolute velocity.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>##  calculate ship velocity 
ship.vel = kilwa.adcp[[&quot;avgSpeed&quot;]]
## obtain absolute velocity
vel.abs = abs(vel-ship.vel)</code></pre>
<p>After ship correction, the profiles of absolute current velocity ranged from 1.493310^{-4} ms<sup>-1</sup> to 4.647 ms<sup>-1</sup> with the median of 0.1234 ms<sup>-1</sup> (figure <a href="#fig:fig9">9</a>). Stitching the profile together and create a section, we noticed a decline of current speed with increase in depth where the surface water has a relatively higher current speed than the deep water (figure <a href="#fig:fig10">10</a>). It also clear the surface current velocity increase from Lindi to around latitude 9 <sup>o</sup>S has relatively lower surface current and increases from 8 <sup>o</sup>S toward Mafia (figure <a href="#fig:fig10">10</a>), which might be caused by East African Coastal Current.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Unlike current meters, ADCP collect current velocity along the vertical and horizontal dimension, hence provide detailed water column circulation. Given the ongoing current measurement with the IIOE-2, we see <code>oce</code> package in R offers and alternative option of CODAS to ingest, process, manipulate and visualize ADCP data under one roof.</p>
