<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><strong>Shiny</strong> is an R package that was created by Joe Cheng. It wraps R code into interactive web applications so R coders do not need to learn HTML, CSS or JavaScript. This tool is powerful and useful, tool available to users of R. <strong>Shiny</strong> provides a framework for building interactive web apps that can be used for visualization, exploratory data analysis, data quality control â€“ really anything that could benefit from an interactive environment. Shiny applications are immeasurably useful for helping users grasp information easily by interacting and querying the app.</p>
<p>This post will not go into the basics of Shiny. There are many resources on the web for getting started, and of particular value is the <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/">RStudio Shiny gallery</a>. However, I will show you the app we just created to help people in the region visualize and make sense of the data in Lake Tanganyika.</p>
