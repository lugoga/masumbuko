<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>For years oceanographers have measured temperature salinity from the surface to the ocean bottom <span class="citation">(Foster, <a href="#ref-foster">1983</a>)</span>. However, our ability to obtain reliable temperature and salinity profiles at fairly resolution both in location and time has been improved through the use of profiling floats from the Argo program <span class="citation">(Roemmich et al., <a href="#ref-roemmich">2009</a>; Rosell-Fieschi, <a href="#ref-RN116">2014</a>; Vilibić &amp; Mihanović, <a href="#ref-vili">2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The Argo program started in the early 2000s with the prime objective of monitoring the upper layer of the world oceans <span class="citation">(Rosell-Fieschi, <a href="#ref-RN116">2014</a>)</span>. The progam has more than 4000 profiling floats distributed in all world ocean that measure the temperature and salinity of the upper 2000 m <span class="citation">(Liu et al., <a href="#ref-liu">2017</a>)</span>, at spatial resolution of one float at three degrees of latitude and longitude <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-RN188">2014</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The distribution of argo floats providing a new profile of temperatue and salinity as a function of depth once every ten days <span class="citation">(Carton &amp; L’Hegaret, <a href="#ref-carton">2011</a>)</span>. Over the past decade, the floats has greatly help us understand how temperature and salinity structures of the upper layer of the world oceans vary both in time and space <span class="citation">(Lauro et al., <a href="#ref-lauro">2014</a>; Thadathil, Bajish, Behera, &amp; Gopalakrishna, <a href="#ref-thad">2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The goal of this post is to provide solid foundation in the most important tools of processing Argo flotas data with R. Wickham and Grolemund in the book R for data science clearly state five important steps—import, tidy, transform, visualize, model and communicate <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-r4d">2016</a>)</span>. I will illustrate the necessary tool in each step following the steps of the analytical model in the <a href="https://semba-blog.netlify.com/09/30/2018/sea-surface-temperature-from-drifter/">Drifter-derived seasonal climatology of Sea surface temperature in the Tropical Indian Ocean</a>. post, except the modeling step.</p>
<div id="import-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Import Data</h3>
<p>I downloaded the delayed mode that Argo program recomments for scientific purpose. This is because the profiles in deyed mode version have been checked for quality ship-based in-situ measurements. The dataset contains adjusted temperature, salinity and pressure variables. I loaded the netcdf files in the workspace with <em>read.oce()</em>, a function from <strong>oce</strong> package <span class="citation">(Kelley &amp; Richards, <a href="#ref-oce">2018</a>)</span>. In addition to oce, other package were loaded into the R for data manipulation <span class="citation">(Wickham, <a href="#ref-tidyverse">2017</a>; Wickham, François, Henry, &amp; Müller, <a href="#ref-dplyr">2018</a>)</span> and visualization <span class="citation">(Kelley, <a href="#ref-ocedata">2015</a>; Wickham, <a href="#ref-ggplot">2016</a>; Xie, <a href="#ref-dt">2018</a>)</span></p>
<pre class="r"><code>require(tidyverse)
require(oce)
require(ocedata)
require(sf)</code></pre>
<p>Because Argo floats have been deployed in the Indian ocean since 2000 and each Argo made several profiles, manual processing the data becomes a daunting task. I use the power of R to iterate the process. The advantge of iteration duplication by automating repeated operations, hence reduce the human error of introducing a bug in the process. <a href="mailto:I@r4d">I@r4d</a> stated that iteration help to do the same thing to multiple inputs: repeating the same operation on different datasets. Before we iterate the process, the netcidfiles were identified with a <em>dir()</em> function of base R.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># list the netcdf file names in the working directory

argo.file = dir(&quot;./argo_profile/&quot;,  #relative path of the directory
                recursive = TRUE, # recurse into directory
                pattern = &quot;_prof.nc&quot;, # choose the names match this condition
                full.names = TRUE) # get name with its relative path</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="tidy-the-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Tidy the data</h3>
<p>Once the files were known, the <strong>for()</strong> function was used to loop over the argo files. To read the file in the directory and process the profiles in the files, a nested loop was needed. A outer loop (i) read the netcdfiles from working directory, remove flags and align to the standard depth. Then the inner (j) loop manipulate the profile of each file. The components of outer loop used to chain the processs in this post are summarized below.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The <strong>output</strong>:<em>argo.ctd = NULL</em>before the looping, I preallocate an empty file to store the iteration output. Allocating files before a loop is very important for efficiency.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>sequence</strong> <em>i in 1:length(argo.file)</em> determine what to loop over. Each run of the for loop will assign <em>i</em> to a differrent value from <em>1:length(argo.file)</em></p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>body</strong>: <em>argo = read.argo(argo.file[i])%&gt;%handleFlags()%&gt;%argoGrid(p = seq(0,2000,5))</em>. This is the code that does the work. It is run repeately, each time with a different value for <em>i</em>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The outer loop reads the netcdf file with <em>read.argo()</em>, then remove all bad profile data with <em>handleFlags()</em> and then align the profile to standard pressure of five meter interval from the surface to 2000 m deep with <em>argoGrid(p = seq(0,2000,5))</em>. The first iteration will run <em>argo = read.argo(argo.file[1])%&gt;%handleFlags()%&gt;%argoGrid(p = seq(0,2000,5))</em>, the second will run <em>argo = read.argo(argo.file[2])%&gt;%handleFlags()%&gt;%argoGrid(p = seq(0,2000,5))</em> and so on until to the last file in the <em>argo.file[i]</em></p>
<p>The inner loops transformed each profile in the argo file into data frame <em>profile = argo.list[[j]]</em>. It then added variables like station name <em>argo = argo.file[i], station = argo.list[[j]][[“station”]]</em> , time the of upload the data <em>time = argo.list[[j]][[“startTime”]]%&gt;%as.Date()</em> , longitude <em>longitude = argo.list[[j]][[“longitude”]]</em>, latitude <em>latitude = argo.list[[j]][[“latitude”]]</em> , and computed the density <em>density = argo.list[[j]]%&gt;%swRho(eos = “gsw”) </em> of each measurement in the profile.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># preallocate a file to store processed ctd data

<p>I then added a seasonal column in the existing data frame with a <em>mutate()</em> function. I divided the seaons into northeast (October to March) and southeast monsoon season (April to September).</p>
