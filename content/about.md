Masumbuko Semba is data scientist works at the [Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology](www.nm-aist.ac.tz) and doctoral student in physical oceanography at the [University of Dar es Salaam](www.udsm.ac.tz). He specializes in Earth Observations and use open-source geo-spatial tools and satellite observations to address physical processes that brings changes in our environments. Among the project Semba is involved is Global Drifter Program. In this Project, he works with the Physical Oceanographic Division of the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to understand the surface circulation dynamics in the Tropical Indian Ocean. To model circulation in this region, he is blending satellite altimetry (geostrophic and sea surface height) with satellite-tracked drifter observations to discover pathways of surface current in the region.
