Masumbuko Semba works at the Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology as data scientist and a doctoral student in physical oceanography at the University of Dar es Salaam. 

Semba specializes in coding using various programming languages. Coding is nothing more than telling a computer what to do in a language the computer understands. Semba created this blog to offer some ground-breaking solutions using open source programming languages affordable worldwide even to third world’s countries.  Learning to code helps develop critical thinking skills and ability to solve problems. 

To start with, the blog will offers easy to read and understand codes for handling, ingesting, transforming, modeling and visualizing data with R. Later codes for other languages such as python and Matlab will be added.
