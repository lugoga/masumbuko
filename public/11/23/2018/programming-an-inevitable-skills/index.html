<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In recent years, there&rsquo;s been an admirable push to get more people to learn programming. But if I&rsquo;ve never been exposed to programming, why should I invest all of the effort to learn? What&rsquo;s in it for me? When I was confronted with data limitation challenge in spreadsheet [@brown], and the issue of repeating the same process over and over again, I decided to learn to program. I started learning R&mdash; a statistical and graphical software [@james]. I then moved to Python [@langtangen], later to Matlab [@trauth]. But now, I do nearly all of my data work in R. A little programming skills obtained by learning R, helped me to do so much more with data than I used to do with out of the box software. Programming skills stretched my brain and ability to work with different types of data.</p>

<p>The skills of knowing how to progrm were apparent recently when I submitted a manuscript in a peer reviewed journal to be considered for publication. After a month of review, they gave me feedback of the review suggesting the manuscript require major revisions that should be done within 21 days. Because I had analysed the data and prepared the manuscript with plain text *<em>rmarkdown</em> [@rmarkdown]. It only took me three days to address the major revision as suggested by reviewer. The revision changed the manuscript by about 85 percent of the origin manuscript. After resubmission the revised version, my manuscript was returned because I had not included the data underlying the findings, and given three weeks to upload the data. I instantly sent the data and <em>script</em><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:R-script-written"><a href="#fn:R-script-written">1</a></sup> used for the manuscript. I had a glimpse of programming, however, with the time bound and a lot of thing to do, the request from this journal seems easier but because I had automated every tasks before. I now realize how much more productive I have become at work with this vital skills and I do not regret at all the time and resources I invested learning how to program.</p>

<p>Using a programming language like R [@r] can look cryptic at first. That is true, like any language, you can not immediately start a conversation. You must know the basics first and the way you practice make you fluency in that language. Honestly, I found learning programming is hard!. There is definitely a learning curve, however, putting in a little time is rewarding in long run as it make routine task much easier. The task that used to take hours of work can now be done within few minutes with code. This code can be replicated to solve other task as well. The other good reason I found about programming is that once you muster one language, it is much easier to learn others because their share almost similar building blocks with minor adjustments.</p>

<p>In summary knowing to code can make you 10 times faster in your daily routine. Because programming help you to automate tedious tasks of cleaning and preparing the data that you would otherwise need to do by hand. If you know how to program, computer-related tasks that used to take you a week to finish will now take only a few hours&mdash;What a relief?</p>

<p>Programming <em>stretch your brain</em> and allows you to discover more creative solutions than your colleagues who don&rsquo;t know how to program. It lets you go beyond simply using the tools and data sets that everyone else around you uses, to transcend the limitations that your peers are stuck with. For example, you&rsquo;ll be able to write programs to automatically acquire data from new sources, to clean, reformat, and integrate that data with your existing data, and to implement far more sophisticated analyses than your colleagues who can only use pre-existing tools.</p>
