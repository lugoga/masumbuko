      <description>IntroductionShumway and Stoffer (2017) in the book with a title Time series analysis and its applications: with R examples clearly stated that when dealing with any time series analysis the first step you ought to do befure further investigation is careful examination of the recorded data. This means before looking more closely at the particular statistical methods, it is appropriate to plot the recorded data against time. This scrutiny often suggests the method of analysis as well as statistics that will be of use in summarizing the information in the data.</description>

      <description>Any quantitative value measured over regular time intervals makes a Time Series. Time-series analysis aims to investigate the temporal behavior of a variable \(X_{t}\). Examples include the investigation of long-term records of sea surface temperature, sea-level fluctuations, millennium-scale variations in the atmosphere-ocean system, the eff ect of the El-Ni√±o/Southern Oscillation on tropical rainfall and sedimentation (Trauth 2015). R has extensive facilities for analyzing time series data. These packages provides various tools with which to detect these temporal patterns.</description>
