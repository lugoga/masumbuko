      <description>One major task for scientists in his their daily routine is to prepare compelling graphics for technical document, reports or manuscripts for publication. Graphics in form of figures carry the weight of the arguments. They need to be clear, attractive and convincing. according to [@], the difference between good and bad figures always lead into the difference between a highly influential or an obscure paper; a grant/contract won or lost; and a job interview gone well or poorly.</description>

      <description>Interactive plots can help users overcome the dilemma of complex or detailed plot like the hour temperature records plotted over a year. They also offers readers an option or tools to explore the plot in detail. R has several package that turn static plot into interactive ones. In this post, I will show you how to create an interactive time series using the dygraphs package developed and maintained by Vanderkam et al.</description>

      <description>Any quantitative value measured over regular time intervals makes a Time Series. Time-series analysis aims to investigate the temporal behavior of a variable \(X_{t}\). Examples include the investigation of long-term records of sea surface temperature, sea-level fluctuations, millennium-scale variations in the atmosphere-ocean system, the eff ect of the El-Niño/Southern Oscillation on tropical rainfall and sedimentation (Trauth 2015). R has extensive facilities for analyzing time series data. These packages provides various tools with which to detect these temporal patterns.</description>

      <title>Isosurface of temperature, salinity, oxygen and fluorescence in Mafia Channel from CTD data </title>

      <description>Iso surfaceOften times we want to visualize the distribution of oceanographic variables across the space at specific depth. That kind of visualization refers to isosurface—layer(s) of constant values of another data variable, such as, constant depth. For this post highlights key steps to create isosurface from CTD profile data in Mafia channel. Because these channel is shallow with an average depth of 20 meters, we will calculate isosurface of f temperature, oxygen, fluorescene at the surface, 10 and 20 meters deep.</description>

      <description>In the previously post, I covered how to read and convert netCDF files directly into R and convert to data frames. The approach is simple and straight forward but there flaws in this approach. One main setback of this approach is its inability to read maltiple matrix in an array from a netcdf file. This inability end up obtain a data frame from the of the first matrice of an array dropping out other matrix.</description>

      <title>Processing Satellite Wind Speed Data with R</title>

      <description>The Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) winds products are processed by NOAA/NESDIS utilizing measurements from the scatterometer instrument aboard the EUMETSAT Metop satellites. The instrument uses radar to measure backscatter to determine speed and direction of winds over the surface of the oceans. ASCAT observations fields have regular spatial resolutions of 0.25° in longitude and latitude.
The daily wind fields are calculated in near real time with a delay of 48 hours.</description>

      <description>IntroductionIn this post I’am going to illustrate how to model in R. As Wickham &amp;amp; Grolemund1 put it
The prime goal of modeling is to provide simple low-dimension summary of a dataset.
I am not going to bring a novel science in this post but rather to help you learn the most important tools in R2 that will allow you to model your data.</description>

      <title>Processing CTD measurements in R with Oce and tidyverse packages</title>

      <description>In the previous post, I illustrate how to process ship-based CTD data with oce1 package in R2 enviroment. We saw the power of this package in reading, summarizing and visualizing CTD data. The downside of oce package in my opinion is its strickest nature of relying on R base for data processing and plotting—preventing customization. Therefore, in this post I will illustrate how to tranforming oce dataset format into a tibble—a modern data frame.</description>

      <description>Introduction: A Brief OverviewThe amount of data being generated by satellites has soared in recent years. The proliferation of remote sensing data can be explained by recent advancements in satellite technologies. However, according to Febvre1, this advancement set another challenge of handling and processing pentabyte of data satellite generates. Thanks to ERDDAP, for being in front-line to overcome this challenge. We can obtain satellite data within the geographical extent of the area we are interested.</description>
