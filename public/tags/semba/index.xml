      <description>worldmet provides an easy way to access data from the NOAA Integrated Surface Database (ISD). The ISD contains detailed surface meteorological data from around the world for over 35,000 locations. See also the map.
The package outputs (typically hourly meteorological data) work very well with the openair package.
InstallationInstallation of worldmet from GitHub is easy using the devtools package.
require(devtools)install_github(&amp;#39;davidcarslaw/worldmet&amp;#39;)require(worldmet)## Loading required package: worldmetrequire(dplyr)## Loading required package: dplyr## ## Attaching package: &amp;#39;dplyr&amp;#39;## The following objects are masked from &amp;#39;package:stats&amp;#39;:## ## filter, lag## The following objects are masked from &amp;#39;package:base&amp;#39;:## ## intersect, setdiff, setequal, unionBrief examplesTo search for meteorological sites the user can search by the name or partial name of the site in upper or lower case.</description>

      <title>Wordclouds plotting with ggwordcloud package in R</title>

      <description>In the previous post, we saw how to make wordcloud graphic using the wordcloud package. In this post we extend the ability of R to make wordcloud graphic, but rather than using the base R function for plotting,I will show how to use ggplot2 framework.
Le Pennec and Slowikowski (2019) developed a gwordcloud package, which extend the capability of ggplot2 package (Wickham 2016) of making cloud text. With the geom_text_wordcloud() function, gwordcloud made making wordcloud plot easy with ggplot2 package.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThe OpenFisheries.org project created an open web platform aimed to advance the practice of data science in fisheries. The project has managed to consolidate global fisheries dataset that can be accessed and retrieved using modern analytics. The OpenFisheries.org flagship project is the Global Fisheries REST API forms the backbone of fisheries data science, enabling reproducible analytics in R (R Core Team, 2019), Python or any other language.</description>

      <description>introductionIn this post I illustrate how to predict the future using the historical data. Time series analysis comprises methods for predicting the future based on the historical in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. In other words, time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.</description>

      <description>Introductionggplot2 packaged for R developed by Hadley Wickham (2016) provides powerful functions for plotting high quality graphs in R.This package has many functions for creating plots among them are pies and donut charts. Pie charts are widely used for showing proportions of mutuallyâ€“exclusive categories. A pie chart is a circular graphic divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportion of the categorial variable. In a pie chart, the length of each slice is equivalent to the counts or proportion of that slice.</description>
