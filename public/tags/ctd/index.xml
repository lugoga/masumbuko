      <description>This post aim to train you how to make an interactive in R. We are going to focus on some poular packages for these task, many are part onf an tidyverse ecosystem (Wickham 2017) with addition of leaflet(Cheng, Karambelkar, and Xie 2018) package. To work with these post you need to have version 3.4 and above of R(R Core Team 2018) installed in your machine.</description>

      <description>Iso surfaceOften times we want to visualize the distribution of oceanographic variables across the space at specific depth. That kind of visualization refers to isosurface—layer(s) of constant values of another data variable, such as, constant depth. For this post highlights key steps to create isosurface from CTD profile data in Mafia channel. Because these channel is shallow with an average depth of 20 meters, we will calculate isosurface of f temperature, oxygen, fluorescene at the surface, 10 and 20 meters deep.</description>

      <description>IntroductionUpper Ocean is characterized for a quasi-homogeneous layer where temperature, salinity and density almost constant with increasing depth (Costoya et al. 2014). This homogeneity layer is caused by turbulent vertical mixing that is driven by heat loss from the ocean to the atmosphere, as well as by wind stress (Stranne et al. 2018). The deepest layer affected by this turbulent mixing is called mixed layer depth (MLD), which marks the width of the upper ocean that interacts with the atmosphere (Kelley 2018).</description>

      <description>IntroductionThe mixed layer is a thin layer with constant temperature and salinity from the surface down to a depth where the values differ from those at the surface (Boyer Montégut et al. 2004). Wind blowing on the ocean stirs the upper layers leading to a thin mixed layer (Stewart 2008). The resulting surface mixed layer is important for local primary production, climate and ocean circulation (Kelley 2018). Although the mixed layer is an important oceanographic parameter, there different approaches that are used and each method depends on the scientific application.</description>

      <title>Using the Derivative Approach to Detect the Mixed Layer Depth (MLD) along the East African Coastal Current from Argo float dataset</title>

      <description>IntroductionIn the previous post, I illustrate how to detect the mixed layer depth (MLD) with the change in temperature criterion approach (\(\Delta T\)). In this post I explain how to detect the MLD using derivatives of water properties based \(\delta T/ \delta z\). With this approach, the thermocline can be detected at a depth where \(\delta T/ \delta z\) is larges, with the region above considered as the mixed layer depth.</description>

      <description>IntroductionI have been working with argo floats data and wrote two post that illustrate how to detect the mixed layer depth with criterion and derivative approaches. In this post, I change the focus. Rather than talking about the mixed layer depth detection, I will illustrate how to calculate the dynamic height and geostrophic velocity from same dataset—Argo float. I use R programming language as an environment for the required routine to calculate the dynamic height and geostrophic current (R Core Team 2018).</description>

      <description>setwd(&amp;quot;E:/Data Manipulation/xtractomatic&amp;quot;)IntroductionThe increasing popularity of ggplot2 package (Wickham, 2016) had made many people becomes familiar with art of grammer of graphics of static plots. But, most of environmental data are static but rather changes both with time and space. Therefore, animated plots are effective way to communicate these dind of data.
Pedersen &amp;amp; Robinson (2017) developed gganimate package that extends the grammar of graphic as implemented with ggplot2 with animations.</description>

      <description>PackagesWe need some packages to process ADCP data. These packages includes
require(oce)require(tidyverse)require(visdat)require(naniar)require(UpSetR)Ingest the ADCPThe LTA dataset was imported into R with read.adp() function from oce package
pemba = read.adp(&amp;quot;./adcp/ADCP_DATA/2007_05/M72-5_OS75011_000000.LTA&amp;quot;)Extract variables containedThe ADCP was collected using the broadband instrument with a frequency of 75KHz making a total of 100 cells spaced at an interval of 16 m making a profile of 1600 m deep.</description>

      <description>Introductionin the previous post, we looked at CTD processing and visualization of profile and section with oce package. We saw the necessary tools needed to import, transform and even plotting oceanographic standard graphics. This post introduce to an ecosystem of packages called tidyverse. The three packages in tidyverse that people use in everyday data analyses include the grammer for graphic ggplot develop by Wickham (2016) for data visualization.</description>

      <description>Oceanographers love MATLAB\(^\circledR\) for processing oceanographic data. I have no explanation as to why they love Matlab. I suppose it’s been the de facto standard within the field for a long time, and legacy is a big deal. I have used Matlab for data processing and plotting for several years. With MatLab I implemented a vast amount of tools and rather completed numerical models. Being a self sponsored graduate student at an institution that doesn’t have a subscription, I found sticking to Matlab not only is expensive, but also unsustainable.</description>

      <description>IntroductionFor years oceanographers have measured temperature and salinity from the surface to the ocean bottom (Foster, 1983). However, our ability to obtain reliable temperature and salinity profiles at fairly resolution both in location and time has been improved through the use of profiling floats from the Argo program (Roemmich et al., 2009; Rosell-Fieschi, 2014; Vilibić &amp;amp; Mihanović, 2013). The Argo program started in the early 2000s with the prime objective of monitoring the upper layer of the world oceans (Rosell-Fieschi, 2014).</description>

      <description>In the previous post, I illustrate how to process ship-based CTD data with oce1 package in R2 enviroment. We saw the power of this package in reading, summarizing and visualizing CTD data. The downside of oce package in my opinion is its strickest nature of relying on R base for data processing and plotting—preventing customization. Therefore, in this post I will illustrate how to tranforming oce dataset format into a tibble—a modern data frame.</description>

      <description>This post introduces to simple analysis of CTD data using oce1 package in R2 environment. CTD stands for conductivity, temperature, and depth, and refers to a package of electronic instruments that measure these properties.A CTD device’s primary function is to detect how the conductivity and temperature of the water column changes relative to depth. Conductivity is a measure of how well a solution conducts electricity. Conductivity is directly related to salinity, which is the concentration of salt and other inorganic compounds in seawater.</description>
