      <description>IntroductionWe had a three days workshop on using R for analytical framework from 12th to 14th July, 2019 at the headquarter of Tanzania Fisheries Reseach Institute (TAFIRI), Dar es Salaam. The workshop was a follow up of similar training conducted in July, 2018. Though the focus of the workshop relied on the base R syntax that does not allow you to express succinctly the coding with pipping, I can honestly say it was one of the most interesting and educational training.</description>

      <description>IntroductionIn recent years, there’s been an admirable push to get more people to learn programming. But if I’ve never been exposed to programming, why should I invest all of the effort to learn? What’s in it for me? When I was confronted with data limitation challenge in spreadsheet (Brown, 2001), and the issue of repeating the same process over and over again, I decided to learn to program. I started learning R— a statistical and graphical software (James, Witten, Hastie, &amp;amp; Tibshirani, 2013).</description>

      <description>Oceanographers love MATLAB\(^\circledR\) for processing oceanographic data. I have no explanation as to why they love Matlab. I suppose it’s been the de facto standard within the field for a long time, and legacy is a big deal. I have used Matlab for data processing and plotting for several years. With MatLab I implemented a vast amount of tools and rather completed numerical models. Being a self sponsored graduate student at an institution that doesn’t have a subscription, I found sticking to Matlab not only is expensive, but also unsustainable.</description>

      <title>The East African Coastal Current captured with satellite-tracked drifter observations</title>

      <description>My interest to explore the EACC comes from its role in linking the boundary currents north of Madagascar and at the equator. It is long established that the East African Coastal Current flows northward along the coast of Tanzania throughout the year1. However, until now we have a rough sketch of the East african coastal current and its seanoal variations. In this post, I am going to illustrate to you how to process drifter data that capture nicely the pathways of the EACC.</description>

      <description>Introduction: A Brief OverviewThe amount of data being generated by satellites has soared in recent years. The proliferation of remote sensing data can be explained by recent advancements in satellite technologies. However, according to Febvre1, this advancement set another challenge of handling and processing pentabyte of data satellite generates. Thanks to ERDDAP, for being in front-line to overcome this challenge. We can obtain satellite data within the geographical extent of the area we are interested.</description>
