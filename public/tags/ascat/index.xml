      <description>Geographic coordinates are often in “degrees” but they can also include “minutes” and “seconds”. This gives us a variety of different formats for reporting the coordinates and you’ll see that different groups will use different formats. Computers do not really work well with DMS coordinates and we really prefer the coordinates to be in Decimal Degrees or DD.
his format allows us to perform standard decimal math operations on the coordinates.</description>

      <title>Processing Satellite Wind Speed Data with R</title>

      <description>The Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) winds products are processed by NOAA/NESDIS utilizing measurements from the scatterometer instrument aboard the EUMETSAT Metop satellites. The instrument uses radar to measure backscatter to determine speed and direction of winds over the surface of the oceans. ASCAT observations fields have regular spatial resolutions of 0.25° in longitude and latitude.
The daily wind fields are calculated in near real time with a delay of 48 hours.</description>
