      <description>In March 2020, The Tanzania Fisheries Research Institute collected oceanographic variable in Coastal waters of Tanga, located in the northern part of Tanzania. After a bit of steaming, we were about 10 km east of Tanga port in the Pemba channel water. The first order of business was to drop some casts and get some data!
CTD ProfilingContinuous measurements of temperature, salinity, oxygen and fluorescence were made with a Sea-Bird SBE-9/11Plus CTD package with dual temperature, salinity and oxygen sensors and fluorometer.</description>
