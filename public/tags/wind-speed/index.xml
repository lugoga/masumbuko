      <description>setwd(&amp;quot;E:/Data Manipulation/xtractomatic&amp;quot;)IntroductionThe increasing popularity of ggplot2 package (Wickham, 2016) had made many people becomes familiar with art of grammer of graphics of static plots. But, most of environmental data are static but rather changes both with time and space. Therefore, animated plots are effective way to communicate these dind of data.
Pedersen &amp;amp; Robinson (2017) developed gganimate package that extends the grammar of graphic as implemented with ggplot2 with animations.</description>

      <description>quikscatIn his An Introduction to the Near–Real–Time QuikSCAT Data, Hoffman (2005) described the primary mission of the SeaWinds instrument on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT ) satellite was to retrieve the surface vector wind over the global ocean (Lungu 2001).
QuikSCAT has provided an extremely accurate and extraordinarily comprehensive view of the surface wind over the global ocean since July 1999 (Chelton et al.</description>

      <description>The Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) winds products are processed by NOAA/NESDIS utilizing measurements from the scatterometer instrument aboard the EUMETSAT Metop satellites. The instrument uses radar to measure backscatter to determine speed and direction of winds over the surface of the oceans. ASCAT observations fields have regular spatial resolutions of 0.25° in longitude and latitude.
The daily wind fields are calculated in near real time with a delay of 48 hours.</description>
