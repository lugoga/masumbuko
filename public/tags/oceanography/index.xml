      <description>Today we will learn about Cartopy, one of the most common packages for making maps within python. Another popular and powerful library is Basemap; however, Basemap is going away and being replaced with Cartopy in the near future, For this reason, investing your time in learning mapping in python with Cartopy module is recommended.
We thank Research in Computing Earth Sciences because most of material in this post are gleaned from their website.</description>

      <description>During the last couple of decades, Matlab has been the most commonly-used scripting language in physical oceanography (Bengtsson 2018), and it has a large user base in many other fields. However, Python has been gaining ground, often being adopted by former Matlab users as well as by newcomers. Here is a little background to help you understand this shift, and why we advocate using Python from the start.
Python was designed by a computer scientist as a generalâ€“purpose scripting language for easy adoption and widespread use.</description>

      <description>In February 2020, The Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS) in collaboration with Tanzania Fisheries Research Institute (TAFIRI) collected oceanographic variables using CTD in coastal waters of Tanga .The sampled area had three transects from the shallow water below 50 meters deep and cruised to the middle of the Pemba channel. The data collection was completed in three days, each day with one transect. We started sampling with the southmost transect located at Kigombe, followed with the middle and finished with the northern transect located near the Tanga city (Figure 1).</description>

      <description>introductionTime series analysis comprises methods for predicting the future based on the historical in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. In other words, time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values. Time series are widely used for non-stationary data, like economic, weather, stock price, and retail sales in this post.</description>

      <description>One major task for scientists in their daily routine is to prepare graphics for technical document, reports or manuscripts for publication. Graphics in form of figures carry the weight of the arguments. They need to be clear, attractive and convincing. according to [@], the difference between good and bad figures always lead into the difference between a highly influential or an obscure paper; a grant/contract won or lost; and a job interview gone well or poorly.</description>
