      <description>In February 2020, The Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS) in collaboration with Tanzania Fisheries Research Institute (TAFIRI) collected oceanographic variables using CTD in coastal waters of Tanga .The sampled area had three transects from the shallow water below 50 meters deep and cruised to the middle of the Pemba channel. The data collection was completed in three days, each day with one transect. We started sampling with the southmost transect located at Kigombe, followed with the middle and finished with the northern transect located near the Tanga city (Figure 1).</description>

      <description>introductionTime series analysis comprises methods for predicting the future based on the historical in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. In other words, time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values. Time series are widely used for non-stationary data, like economic, weather, stock price, and retail sales in this post.</description>

      <description>One major task for scientists in their daily routine is to prepare graphics for technical document, reports or manuscripts for publication. Graphics in form of figures carry the weight of the arguments. They need to be clear, attractive and convincing. according to [@], the difference between good and bad figures always lead into the difference between a highly influential or an obscure paper; a grant/contract won or lost; and a job interview gone well or poorly.</description>
