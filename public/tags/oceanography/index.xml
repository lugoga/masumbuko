      <description>In March 2020, The Tanzania Fisheries Research Institute collected oceanographic variable in Coastal waters of Tanga, located in the northern part of Tanzania. After a bit of steaming, we were about 10 km east of Tanga port in the Pemba channel water. The first order of business was to drop some casts and get some data!
CTD ProfilingContinuous measurements of temperature, salinity, oxygen and fluorescence were made with a Sea-Bird SBE-9/11Plus CTD package with dual temperature, salinity and oxygen sensors and fluorometer.</description>

      <description>introductionTime series analysis comprises methods for predicting the future based on the historical in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. In other words, time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values. Time series are widely used for non-stationary data, like economic, weather, stock price, and retail sales in this post.</description>

      <description>One major task for scientists in their daily routine is to prepare graphics for technical document, reports or manuscripts for publication. Graphics in form of figures carry the weight of the arguments. They need to be clear, attractive and convincing. according to [@], the difference between good and bad figures always lead into the difference between a highly influential or an obscure paper; a grant/contract won or lost; and a job interview gone well or poorly.</description>
