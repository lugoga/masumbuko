      <description>Needed PackagesWe need to load some packages into R that are used to process the data. The chunk below show the list of packages I selected that I will use to import the data, manipulate, transform and last presented the results in form of maps. One of the package is the tidyverse, which loads five other packages — ggplot2, tibble, tidyr, readr, purrr, and dplyr packages. These are considered to be the core of the tidyverse because are mostly used in almost every analysis.</description>

      <description>In the previous post, I illustrate how to process ship-based CTD data with oce1 package in R2 enviroment. We saw the power of this package in reading, summarizing and visualizing CTD data. The downside of oce package in my opinion is its strickest nature of relying on R base for data processing and plotting—preventing customization. Therefore, in this post I will illustrate how to tranforming oce dataset format into a tibble—a modern data frame.</description>
