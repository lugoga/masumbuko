      <title>Using the Derivative Approach to Detect the Mixed Layer Depth (MLD) along the East African Coastal Current from Argo float dataset</title>

      <description>IntroductionIn the previous post, I illustrate how to detect the mixed layer depth (MLD) with the change in temperature criterion approach (\(\Delta T\)). In this post I explain how to detect the MLD using derivatives of water properties based \(\delta T/ \delta z\). With this approach, the thermocline can be detected at a depth where \(\delta T/ \delta z\) is larges, with the region above considered as the mixed layer depth.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThe ocean mixed layer is narrow band of the suface water that is homogenous—where temperature, salinity and density scarcely vary with increasing depth (Costoya et al. 2014). This homogeneity layer is caused by turbulent vertical mixing that is driven by heat loss from the ocean to the atmosphere and wind stress. The deepest layer affected by this turbulent mixing is called mixed layer depth (MLD), which marks the width of the upper ocean that interacts with the atmosphere.</description>

      <description>IntroductionI have been working with argo floats data and wrote two post that illustrate how to detect the mixed layer depth with criterion and derivative approaches. In this post, I change the focus. Rather than talking about the mixed layer depth detection, I will illustrate how to calculate the dynamic height and geostrophic velocity from same dataset—Argo float. I use R programming language as an environment for the required routine to calculate the dynamic height and geostrophic current (R Core Team 2018).</description>

      <description>setwd(&amp;quot;E:/Data Manipulation/xtractomatic&amp;quot;)IntroductionThe increasing popularity of ggplot2 package (Wickham, 2016) had made many people becomes familiar with art of grammer of graphics of static plots. But, most of environmental data are static but rather changes both with time and space. Therefore, animated plots are effective way to communicate these dind of data.
Pedersen &amp;amp; Robinson (2017) developed gganimate package that extends the grammar of graphic as implemented with ggplot2 with animations.</description>

      <description>IntroductionFor years oceanographers have measured temperature and salinity from the surface to the ocean bottom (Foster, 1983). However, our ability to obtain reliable temperature and salinity profiles at fairly resolution both in location and time has been improved through the use of profiling floats from the Argo program (Roemmich et al., 2009; Rosell-Fieschi, 2014; Vilibić &amp;amp; Mihanović, 2013). The Argo program started in the early 2000s with the prime objective of monitoring the upper layer of the world oceans (Rosell-Fieschi, 2014).</description>

      <description>Introduction: A Brief OverviewThe amount of data being generated by satellites has soared in recent years. The proliferation of remote sensing data can be explained by recent advancements in satellite technologies. However, according to Febvre1, this advancement set another challenge of handling and processing pentabyte of data satellite generates. Thanks to ERDDAP, for being in front-line to overcome this challenge. We can obtain satellite data within the geographical extent of the area we are interested.</description>
