      <description>setwd(&amp;quot;E:/Data Manipulation/xtractomatic&amp;quot;)IntroductionThe increasing popularity of ggplot2 package (Wickham, 2016) had made many people becomes familiar with art of grammer of graphics of static plots. But, most of environmental data are static but rather changes both with time and space. Therefore, animated plots are effective way to communicate these dind of data.
Pedersen &amp;amp; Robinson (2017) developed gganimate package that extends the grammar of graphic as implemented with ggplot2 with animations.</description>

      <description>Introductionin the previous post, we looked at CTD processing and visualization of profile and section with oce package. We saw the necessary tools needed to import, transform and even plotting oceanographic standard graphics. This post introduce to an ecosystem of packages called tidyverse. The three packages in tidyverse that people use in everyday data analyses include the grammer for graphic ggplot develop by Wickham (2016) for data visualization.</description>

      <description>This post introduces to simple analysis of CTD data using oce1 package in R2 environment. CTD stands for conductivity, temperature, and depth, and refers to a package of electronic instruments that measure these properties.A CTD deviceâ€™s primary function is to detect how the conductivity and temperature of the water column changes relative to depth. Conductivity is a measure of how well a solution conducts electricity. Conductivity is directly related to salinity, which is the concentration of salt and other inorganic compounds in seawater.</description>
