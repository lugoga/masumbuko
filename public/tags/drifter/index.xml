      <description>IntroductionIn this routine, I am going to illustrate the routines of validating sea surface temperatures from Moderate resolution (MODIS) and drifters. Drifters serve as in-situ data against which the SST from MODIS is tested. The purpose is to assess how accurate the satellite observation is to the in-situ measurements. We will test the accuracy of the two dataset and look on their relationship.</description>

      <description>Introduction: A Brief OverviewThe amount of data being generated by satellites has soared in recent years. The proliferation of remote sensing data can be explained by recent advancements in satellite technologies. However, according to Febvre1, this advancement set another challenge of handling and processing pentabyte of data satellite generates. Thanks to ERDDAP, for being in front-line to overcome this challenge. We can obtain satellite data within the geographical extent of the area we are interested.</description>
