      <description>Today we will learn about Cartopy, one of the most common packages for making maps within python. Another popular and powerful library is Basemap; however, Basemap is going away and being replaced with Cartopy in the near future, For this reason, investing your time in learning mapping in python with Cartopy module is recommended.

      <description>During the last couple of decades, Matlab has been the most commonly-used scripting language in physical oceanography (Bengtsson 2018), and it has a large user base in many other fields. However, Python has been gaining ground, often being adopted by former Matlab users as well as by newcomers. Here is a little background to help you understand this shift, and why we advocate using Python from the start.
Python was designed by a computer scientist as a generalâ€“purpose scripting language for easy adoption and widespread use.</description>
