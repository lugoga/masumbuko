      <description>PackagesWe need some packages to process ADCP data. These packages includes
require(oce)require(tidyverse)require(visdat)require(naniar)require(UpSetR)Ingest the ADCPThe LTA dataset was imported into R with read.adp() function from oce package
pemba = read.adp(&amp;quot;./adcp/ADCP_DATA/2007_05/M72-5_OS75011_000000.LTA&amp;quot;)Extract variables containedThe ADCP was collected using the broadband instrument with a frequency of 75KHz making a total of 100 cells spaced at an interval of 16 m making a profile of 1600 m deep.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThe Second International Indian Ocean Expedition (IIOE-2) collected various oceanographic data within the coastal water of Tanzania. Among the oceanographic data collected using Agulhas II, is the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiles (ADCP). The measurement was carried out from 4th to 9th November 2017. In this post, I will illustrate how to process the ADCP data with R using oce package developed by Kelley &amp;amp; Richards (2018).</description>
