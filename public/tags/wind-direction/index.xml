      <description>setwd(&amp;quot;E:/Data Manipulation/xtractomatic&amp;quot;)IntroductionThe increasing popularity of ggplot2 package (Wickham, 2016) had made many people becomes familiar with art of grammer of graphics of static plots. But, most of environmental data are static but rather changes both with time and space. Therefore, animated plots are effective way to communicate these dind of data.

      <description>quikscatIn his An Introduction to the Near–Real–Time QuikSCAT Data, Hoffman (2005) described the primary mission of the SeaWinds instrument on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT ) satellite was to retrieve the surface vector wind over the global ocean (Lungu 2001).
QuikSCAT has provided an extremely accurate and extraordinarily comprehensive view of the surface wind over the global ocean since July 1999 (Chelton et al.</description>
