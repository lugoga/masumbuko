      <description>A map projection is a way to flatten a globe’s surface into a plane in order to make a map. This requires a systematic transformation of the latitudes and longitudes of locations from the surface of the globe into locations on a plane.[1] All projections of a sphere on a plane necessarily distort the surface in some way and to some extent. Depending on the purpose of the map, some distortions are acceptable and others are not; therefore, different map projections exist in order to preserve some properties of the sphere-like body at the expense of other properties.</description>

      <description>There are many different things that requires oceanographers to code and write scripts that automate routinely analytical frameworks. However, there is one common use amongst almost all every report, research project or paper will need to have—map indicating to a study area. There are many packages that are often used to make maps in R. And heaps of blog posts, books and tutorials that illustrate different ways to visualize spatial data in R.</description>
