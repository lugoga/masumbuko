      <description>Kernel density estimation is a popular tool for visualizing the distribution of data. In this post, we are going to look on how to create smoothed map of random points. We will use a shapefile dataset that contains potential fishing zones derived from sea surface temperature recorded between January and June 2020 in Pemba channel. You can simply download the file from this link.
Once you have downloaded the file, unzip and browse in the uncompressed file you find the shapefile pfz.</description>

      <description>Making graphics and maps is one of the important skills for oceanographers and marine scientists. Maps are often used by scientists to locate areas of interest—where the study being presented was conducted. Thus ability to make maps that convey the message in a simple manner form an important first impression for readers. Despite this, software tools for producing high-quality maps are non-trivial to use.
In this post I illustrate how some key lines of code for access, download and map the spatial distribution of chlorophyll-a concentration within the Rufiji-Mafia Channel using a combination of packages in the R environment.</description>

      <title>Validating MODIS Sea Surface Temperature with Global Drifter Program Observations</title>

      <description>IntroductionIn this post, I am going to illustrate routines of how to validate sea surface temperatures from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with drifters’ sea surface temperature. Drifters measurements serve as in-situ data against MODIS data. The purpose is to assess closeneness (accuracy) of satellite and in-situ SST. I will check the accuracy of acquired (satellite) and measured (drifter) SST, visualize their relationship and test the significance of the relationship.</description>
