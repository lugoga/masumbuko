      <description>In this post I explain how to read the NetCDF file of aviso in R. I also showed how to make plot of the processed sea surface height with ggplot2 package (Wickham 2016) and also animated a series of map with gganimate packages (Pedersen and Robinson 2017). However, the link that I used to obtain the data is no longer active and people find difficult to follow the instructions in the post.</description>

      <description>In the previously post, I covered how to read and convert netCDF files directly into R and convert to data frames. The approach is simple and straight forward but there flaws in this approach. One main setback of this approach is its inability to read maltiple matrix in an array from a netcdf file. This inability end up obtain a data frame from the of the first matrice of an array dropping out other matrix.</description>
