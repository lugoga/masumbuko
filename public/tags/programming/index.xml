      <description>If you work with data science, R and Python must be the two programming languages that you use the most. Both R and Python are quite robust languages and either one of them is actually sufficient to carry out the data analysis task. However, instead of considering them as tools that supplement each other, more often you will find people dealing with data claim one language to be better than the other.</description>

      <description>IntroductionA word cloud is a visual representation of word, with more frequent word appear large and bold and less frequency small. In other words the more often a word occurs within a body of text, the larger it appears in the word cloud. This allows you to see immediately which words are most prominent and maybe most important. This state–of–the–art data analysis is widely refered to as text data mining and other call it text analytics.</description>

      <title>Wordclouds plotting with ggwordcloud package in R</title>

      <description>In the previous post, we saw how to make wordcloud graphic using the wordcloud package. In this post we extend the ability of R to make wordcloud graphic, but rather than using the base R function for plotting,I will show how to use ggplot2 framework.
Le Pennec and Slowikowski (2019) developed a gwordcloud package, which extend the capability of ggplot2 package (Wickham 2016) of making cloud text. With the geom_text_wordcloud() function, gwordcloud made making wordcloud plot easy with ggplot2 package.</description>
