      <description>IntroductionA word cloud is a visual representation of word, with more frequent word appear large and bold and less frequency small. In other words the more often a word occurs within a body of text, the larger it appears in the word cloud. This allows you to see immediately which words are most prominent and maybe most important. This state–of–the–art data analysis is widely refered to as text data mining and other call it text analytics.</description>

      <description>In the previous post, we saw how to make wordcloud graphic using the wordcloud package. In this post we extend the ability of R to make wordcloud graphic, but rather than using the base R function for plotting,I will show how to use ggplot2 framework.
Le Pennec and Slowikowski (2019) developed a gwordcloud package, which extend the capability of ggplot2 package (Wickham 2016) of making cloud text. With the geom_text_wordcloud() function, gwordcloud made making wordcloud plot easy with ggplot2 package.</description>
