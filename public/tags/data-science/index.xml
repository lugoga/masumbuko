      <description>One of the most important components of a data management strategy is the proper handling of missing values. Often you will find datasets that have used either zero or NA to represent missing values in cell of a data frame or table. The question that may sober our mind is that, which of the two way of storing missing value in the data is right? You will notice that everyone who deals with data has to deal with this important distinction.</description>

      <title>Geographical coordinates conversion made easy with parzer package in R</title>

      <description>Geographic coordinates are often in “degrees” but they can also include “minutes” and “seconds”. This gives us a variety of different formats for reporting the coordinates and you’ll see that different groups will use different formats. Computers do not really work well with DMS coordinates and we really prefer the coordinates to be in Decimal Degrees or DD.
This format allows us to perform standard decimal math operations on the coordinates.</description>

      <title>Access meteorogical observations using worldmet package</title>

      <description>David Carslaw (2019) developed R package worldmet, which provides an easy way to access world meteorological data from from the Integrated Surface Database of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The Integrated Surface Database (ISD) consists of global hourly and synoptic observations compiled from numerous sources into a single common ASCII format and common data model.</description>

      <title>Wordclouds plotting with ggwordcloud package in R</title>

      <description>In the previous post, we saw how to make wordcloud graphic using the wordcloud package. In this post we extend the ability of R to make wordcloud graphic, but rather than using the base R function for plotting,I will show how to use ggplot2 framework.
Le Pennec and Slowikowski (2019) developed a gwordcloud package, which extend the capability of ggplot2 package (Wickham 2016) of making cloud text. With the geom_text_wordcloud() function, gwordcloud made making wordcloud plot easy with ggplot2 package.</description>
