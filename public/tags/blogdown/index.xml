      <description>In this post I explain how to read the NetCDF file of aviso in R. I also showed how to make plot of the processed sea surface height with ggplot2 package (Wickham 2016) and also animated a series of map with gganimate packages (Pedersen and Robinson 2017). However, the link that I used to obtain the data is no longer active and people find difficult to follow the instructions in the post.</description>

      <description>You are creating a report based on some analysis you are doing in R. You are pasting code snippes and figures into your report document. The document is reviewed and you got comments and feedback of something went wrong in your report and you ought to redo it all over again.
The publishing tools in Rstudio allows you to run a script and automaticaly generate document containing the results, including images of each figures generated and imported; the code chunk and code blocks with text and mathematical equations that you insert and inserting references cited.</description>
