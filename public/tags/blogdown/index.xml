      <description>Making graphics and maps is one of the important skills for oceanographers and marine scientists. Maps are often used by scientists to locate areas of interestâ€”where the study being presented was conducted. Thus ability to make maps that convey the message in a simple manner form an important first impression for readers. Despite this, software tools for producing high-quality maps are non-trivial to use.
In this post I illustrate how some key lines of code for access, download and map the spatial distribution of chlorophyll-a concentration within the Rufiji-Mafia Channel using a combination of packages in the R environment.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThe OpenFisheries.org project created an open web platform aimed to advance the practice of data science in fisheries. The project has managed to consolidate global fisheries dataset that can be accessed and retrieved using modern analytics. The OpenFisheries.org flagship project is the Global Fisheries REST API forms the backbone of fisheries data science, enabling reproducible analytics in R (R Core Team, 2019), Python or any other language.</description>

      <description>In this post I explain how to read the NetCDF file of aviso in R. I also showed how to make plot of the processed sea surface height with ggplot2 package (Wickham 2016) and also animated a series of map with gganimate packages (Pedersen and Robinson 2017). However, the link that I used to obtain the data is no longer active and people find difficult to follow the instructions in the post.</description>

      <description>You are creating a report based on some analysis you are doing in R. You are pasting code snippes and figures into your report document. The document is reviewed and you got comments and feedback of something went wrong in your report and you ought to redo it all over again.
The publishing tools in Rstudio allows you to run a script and automaticaly generate document containing the results, including images of each figures generated and imported; the code chunk and code blocks with text and mathematical equations that you insert and inserting references cited.</description>
