      <description>The study of sea surface temperature (SST) is one of the cornerstone of oceanography. It has applications not only in physics, chemistry and the earth’s sciences, but in subjects as diverse as biology and economics. SST plays an important role in our quantitative understanding of coastal habitats and species distribution in our global oceans.
It was until the launch of The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) early 2000s, oceanographers were unable to obtain information of SST at fairly resolution.</description>

      <description>My interest to explore the EACC comes from its role in linking the boundary currents north of Madagascar and at the equator. It is long established that the East African Coastal Current flows northward along the coast of Tanzania throughout the year1. However, until now we have a rough sketch of the East african coastal current and its seanoal variations. In this post, I am going to illustrate to you how to process drifter data that capture nicely the pathways of the EACC.</description>

      <description>In the previous post, I illustrate how to process ship-based CTD data with oce1 package in R2 enviroment. We saw the power of this package in reading, summarizing and visualizing CTD data. The downside of oce package in my opinion is its strickest nature of relying on R base for data processing and plotting—preventing customization. Therefore, in this post I will illustrate how to tranforming oce dataset format into a tibble—a modern data frame.</description>

      <description>This post introduces to simple analysis of CTD data using oce1 package in R2 environment. CTD stands for conductivity, temperature, and depth, and refers to a package of electronic instruments that measure these properties.A CTD device’s primary function is to detect how the conductivity and temperature of the water column changes relative to depth. Conductivity is a measure of how well a solution conducts electricity. Conductivity is directly related to salinity, which is the concentration of salt and other inorganic compounds in seawater.</description>
