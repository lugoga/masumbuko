      <title>Using the Derivative Approach to Detect the Mixed Layer Depth (MLD) along the East African Coastal Current from Argo float dataset</title>

      <description>IntroductionIn the previous post, I illustrate how to detect the mixed layer depth (MLD) with the change in temperature criterion approach (\(\Delta T\)). In this post I explain how to detect the MLD using derivatives of water properties based \(\delta T/ \delta z\). With this approach, the thermocline can be detected at a depth where \(\delta T/ \delta z\) is larges, with the region above considered as the mixed layer depth.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThe ocean mixed layer is narrow band of the suface water that is homogenous—where temperature, salinity and density scarcely vary with increasing depth (Costoya et al. 2014). This homogeneity layer is caused by turbulent vertical mixing that is driven by heat loss from the ocean to the atmosphere and wind stress. The deepest layer affected by this turbulent mixing is called mixed layer depth (MLD), which marks the width of the upper ocean that interacts with the atmosphere.</description>

      <description>IntroductionI have been working with argo floats data and wrote two post that illustrate how to detect the mixed layer depth with criterion and derivative approaches. In this post, I change the focus. Rather than talking about the mixed layer depth detection, I will illustrate how to calculate the dynamic height and geostrophic velocity from same dataset—Argo float. I use R programming language as an environment for the required routine to calculate the dynamic height and geostrophic current (R Core Team 2018).</description>

      <description>setwd(&amp;quot;E:/Data Manipulation/xtractomatic&amp;quot;)IntroductionThe increasing popularity of ggplot2 package (Wickham, 2016) had made many people becomes familiar with art of grammer of graphics of static plots. But, most of environmental data are static but rather changes both with time and space. Therefore, animated plots are effective way to communicate these dind of data.
Pedersen &amp;amp; Robinson (2017) developed gganimate package that extends the grammar of graphic as implemented with ggplot2 with animations.</description>

      <description>Introductionin the previous post, we looked at CTD processing and visualization of profile and section with oce package. We saw the necessary tools needed to import, transform and even plotting oceanographic standard graphics. This post introduce to an ecosystem of packages called tidyverse. The three packages in tidyverse that people use in everyday data analyses include the grammer for graphic ggplot develop by Wickham (2016) for data visualization.</description>

      <description>Oceanographers love MATLAB\(^\circledR\) for processing oceanographic data. I have no explanation as to why they love Matlab. I suppose it’s been the de facto standard within the field for a long time, and legacy is a big deal. I have used Matlab for data processing and plotting for several years. With MatLab I implemented a vast amount of tools and rather completed numerical models. Being a self sponsored graduate student at an institution that doesn’t have a subscription, I found sticking to Matlab not only is expensive, but also unsustainable.</description>

      <title>Seasonal Climatology of temperature and salinity in the WIO region from Argo floats </title>

      <description>IntroductionFor years oceanographers have measured temperature and salinity from the surface to the ocean bottom (Foster, 1983). However, our ability to obtain reliable temperature and salinity profiles at fairly resolution both in location and time has been improved through the use of profiling floats from the Argo program (Roemmich et al., 2009; Rosell-Fieschi, 2014; Vilibić &amp;amp; Mihanović, 2013). The Argo program started in the early 2000s with the prime objective of monitoring the upper layer of the world oceans (Rosell-Fieschi, 2014).</description>

      <description>In the previous post, I illustrate how to process ship-based CTD data with oce1 package in R2 enviroment. We saw the power of this package in reading, summarizing and visualizing CTD data. The downside of oce package in my opinion is its strickest nature of relying on R base for data processing and plotting—preventing customization. Therefore, in this post I will illustrate how to tranforming oce dataset format into a tibble—a modern data frame.</description>

      <description>This post introduces to simple analysis of CTD data using oce1 package in R2 environment. CTD stands for conductivity, temperature, and depth, and refers to a package of electronic instruments that measure these properties.A CTD device’s primary function is to detect how the conductivity and temperature of the water column changes relative to depth. Conductivity is a measure of how well a solution conducts electricity. Conductivity is directly related to salinity, which is the concentration of salt and other inorganic compounds in seawater.</description>
